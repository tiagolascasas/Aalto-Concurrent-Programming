package atomicReference
/* One issue that needs to be noted when implementing concurrent
 * programs is memory consistency and errors associated with it. We 
 * say memory consistency error occured when multiple execution units
 * operating on a shared memory have inconsistent view of a given 
 * shared variable. There are a lot of reasons why this inconsistanceies 
 * happen which include caching and compiler optimizations. The key to 
 * avoid memory concistency problem is to understand and insure happens-before
 * relationship such that if a happens-before b, the effects of a will be visible 
 * to b.
 *    
 * Task: In this exercise we implement a simple atomic reference; a container to a value 
 * that may be updated atomically and provides a happen-before relationship when
 * reading and writing a value.  
 *
 * Hint: You may use syncronized key word to implement happens-before

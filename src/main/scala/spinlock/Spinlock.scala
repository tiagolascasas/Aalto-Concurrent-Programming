/* One way of enforcing limits on access to a shared resource in a multi-threaded 
 * execution environment is using locks. A lock is an important low-level synchronization
 * mechanism used to enforce mutual exclusion and concurrency control policy. 
 * 
 * A spinlock is a lock which causes a thread trying to acquire it to simply wait in a 
 * loop ("spin") while repeatedly checking if the lock is available.
 *    
 * Task: In this exercise, we implement a simple spinlock with lock and unlock methods.
 * we will assume we have an implementation of a simple atomic integer with a compare 
 * set method and base our spinlock implementation on it. The compare and set method is 
 * defined as compareAndSet(expect: Int, update: Int): Boolean.  
 *
 * Hint: refer and use compareAndSet(expect: Int, update: Int): Boolean method from 
 * past exercises

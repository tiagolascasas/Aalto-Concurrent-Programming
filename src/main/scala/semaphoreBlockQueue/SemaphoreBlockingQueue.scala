/*
* Another way of implementing a Blocking Queue is using semaphores. As we have encountered in the 
* previous exercises a Blocking Queue is a queue that blocks when you try to take from it and the 
* queue is empty, or if you try to put items to it and the queue is already full. A semaphore, 
* on the other hand, is an important abstract data type used to control access to a common resource 
* required by multiple execution units (threads) in a concurrent system.
*
* Task: In this exercise, we will implement a Blocking Queue based on a Semaphore similar 
* to what we have implemented in the last exercise. You are given Semaphore which has 
* acquire() and release() methods. You will need to base your Blocking Queue implementation on this 
* Semaphore. The Full interface definition of Semaphore is as follows: 
*     
*    class Semaphore(private val capacity: Int) extends Monitor {
*        var permits = capacity
*        def acquire(): Unit
*        def release(): Unit
*        def availablePermits(): Int = permits
*    }
*
* Hint: Take a look at the hints in the previous exercises related to Semaphore and Monitor Blocking Queue.
*

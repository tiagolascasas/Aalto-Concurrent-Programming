# Aalto-Concurrent-Programming

This repository contains a Scala sbt project containing all the exercises developed on the Concurrent Programming course (CS-E4110) at Aalto University, 2019-2020.

Testing code and schedulable objects are not included due to dependency hell issues, but all the implementations of the concurrent structures has passed the unit tests on A+ successfully. Please also notice that the original exercises had one project per package, but they have all been merged into a single project here.
